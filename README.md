Ponto de Encontro
================

What is it?
-----------

This is the website for the Ponto de Encontro solidarity platform. Ponto de Encontro is a phone chat for people with visual impairement.
The main goal of this project is to aid visually impaired people who live in isolation and have minimal to no contact at all with the world.

As I wanted to learn more about accessibility I thought that I could contribute to this project by building this website, trying to follow
accessibility good practices.

Roadmap:

[] Static website with all the content about the project

[] Add some design

[] Back office to edit the content (allows a blog section in the future?)

[] Create some sort of content (videos?) that guide people on what Ponto de Encontro is, and how to take advantage of it
